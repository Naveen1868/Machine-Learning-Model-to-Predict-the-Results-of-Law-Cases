# Machine Learning Model to Predict the Results of Law Cases

This project is aimed at predicting the outcomes of legal cases using a Machine Learning model. It takes FIR (First Information Report) and Section data as input and classifies the type of punishment expected, helping legal professionals get early insights into possible results.
